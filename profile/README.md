    Absoulutely! Everything here is MIT licensed. Though, please do not sell, claiming it's yours or many other stuff through my code. This website is license under MIT.

<h2>Is the mods in the website open source?</h2>
<p>
    Depends on what the people make. We highly suggest to make your mods open source. If you make your mod close-sourced, that's fine! But we'll have to put a <codeblock>[NOT OPEN SOURCE]</codeblock> tag to let people know.
